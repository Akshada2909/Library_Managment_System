# Library_Managment_System


## Project Overview
The Library Management System is a **console-based Java application** developed to manage library operations efficiently.  
It allows users to manage books and members, search books, and perform borrowing and returning operations using a **menu-driven interface**.

This project is created as part of **Week 3 Internship Task** to demonstrate **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts**, proper encapsulation, and structured program design in Java.

---

## Project Objectives
- To understand Object-Oriented Programming fundamentals
- To implement classes and objects in Java
- To apply encapsulation and data hiding
- To manage books and members in a library system
- To build a menu-driven console application
- To practice real-world class relationships

---

## Technologies Used
- Java (JDK 8 or above)
- Spring Tool Suite (STS) / Eclipse
- GitHub
- GitHub Desktop
- Scanner class for user input

---

## Features
- Add and manage books
- Register library members
- Search books by title or author
- Borrow and return books
- Validate book availability
- Menu-driven user interface
- Proper encapsulation using getters and setters

## How to Run the Project
1. Install **Java JDK (8 or above)**
2. Install **Spring Tool Suite (STS)**
3. Clone or download this repository
4. Open STS → File → Import → Existing Projects into Workspace
5. Select the project folder and click **Finish**
6. Open `LibrarySystem.java`
7. Right-click → **Run As → Java Application**
8. Follow the menu instructions in the console

---

## OOP Concepts Used
- **Encapsulation**: Private fields with public getters and setters
- **Abstraction**: Library operations handled through separate classes
- **Modularity**: Each class has a specific responsibility
- **Object Interaction**: Book, Member, and Library classes interact logically
